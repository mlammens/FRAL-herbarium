**Abstract**

Herbaria records offer a rich source of information for understanding the patterns and processes of species spread. 
However, analyses of these data requires careful consideration of the potential effects of unequal sampling effort in space and time.
I used herbaria records to investigate the rate of spread and pattern of establishment for the invasive shrub *Frangula alnus* in northeastern and middle North America.
I collected \>700 accession records from herbaria throughout North America for *F.
alnus* covering a temporal range from ca. 1880-Present and a spatial range covering the entire invaded area in North America.
I addressed unequal sampling effort by comparing temporal and spatial patterns of *F. alnus* accessions to patterns in a group of ecological similar native species.
Trends in record collection in time and space show the rate of spread of *F. alnus* was slow and spatially limited during the late 19^th^ century, then increased rapidly during the early 20^th^ century, and reached a relatively constant rate of spread in the later 20^th^ century.
Examining the spread of this species at the continental scale, there is little evidence that it experienced an extended lag phase between phases of establishment and rapid spatial spread, in contradiction to common trends for non-native plants and to previous reports for this species in particular.
Rather, it appears that *F. alnus* has steadily increased in area of occupancy from ca.
1920 to the present.

**Introduction**

Despite decades of research on invasive species, we still lack a full understanding of population dynamics during the transition from establishment of self-sustaining populations in a novel region to the rapid growth in abundance and expansion of area of occupancy.
From field observations and patterns in historical data, it is generally noted that the time from establishment to rapid spread is longer than a generation time for many invasive species.
This period is thought to be one in which population growth, both in numbers and area, is relatively small, and is commonly referred to as the lag phase [@Kowarik1995; @Crooks1999; @Sakai2001; @Crooks2005; @Pysek2005; @Theoharides2007].
Because the lag phase is associated with a period early in the invasion process, management actions taken during this time have the potential to be most affective at mitigating the negative impacts of a species invasion.

To understand processes governing population dynamics during a lag phase, it is first necessary to identify this period.
Quantifying the lag phase for a species has many challenges.
Assuming a non-native species establishes in an environment suitable for growth and reproduction, and ignoring potential positive density dependence effects (i.e.
Allee effects), population size should initially increase exponentially (Figure 1A).
Exponential growth is described as *N(t) = N(0) R^t^*, where *t =* time-step, *N(t)* = the population size at time-step *t*, and *R* is the population growth rate.
Looking at a plot of population size through time for an exponentially growing population suggests that early on the population size is relatively similar to *N(0)* (Figure 1A; *R* = 1.2 for the black dots), which is followed by a transition to a period of rapid population increase.
Crooks and Soulé (1999) describe this as “the shallow portion early in the growth curve when the population is growing relatively slowly in absolute number” and define it as the **inherent lag**.
This pattern is common to all exponential growth curves, and thus all growing populations should appear to have at least an inherent lag phase.
However, because a mathematical definition of inherent lag is lacking, it is challenging to apply this concept.
In the case of exponential population growth, a plot of the *log* of population size versus time shows a linear relationship (Figure 1B; *R* = 1.2 for black dots).
The population growth rate is constant through time and there is no distinct transition point that can define the shift from the inherent lag phase to the rapid population growth phase.

While an inherent lag is not explicitly defined mathematically, it serves as a contrast to the pattern of population growth showing an **extended lag**.
In this case, the population growth rate changes in time, with a lower rate earlier in time, followed by a higher rate later.
The grey dots in Figures 1A and B are growth curves for a population whose initial growth rate is *R = 1* and increases to *R = 1.2* during the first 20 time steps.
As with population growth with constant *R*, the curve of population size versus time is non-linear (Figure 1A).
However, in this case the curve of the log of population size versus time is also non-linear when *R* is increasing.
The non-linear portion of the curve, where the slope is shallow and the curve is concave up, is considered evidence for an extended lag [@Crooks1999].
Patterns of population growth for many invasive species match that expected for an extended lag phase.
The potential factors causing this are not well understood; several ecological and evolutionary processes may be involved [@Mack2000; @Sakai2001; @Pysek2005; @Gurevitch2011]
An extended lag may be explained by time constraints intrinsic to population growth and establishment, such as generation time and time to first reproduction (i.e., the time required for a population to achieve a stable age distribution).
However, many observed extended lag phases are longer than can be explained by these processes.

In a recent study of weedy species in New Zealand, Aikio et al. [-@aAikio2010a] point out that while there are several proposed mechanisms that may explain extended lags, relatively little empirical work has been done to examine their validity.
Among the most well studied mechanisms in a theoretical context are the role of evolutionary adaptation of the invader during the lag phase, waiting time until a disturbance event avails resources to the invader, and the role of complex dispersal mechanisms (for a general review see [@Crooks2005]).
Historical biodiversity data from herbaria and museums could be applied to address this lack of empirical support and further our understanding of the population dynamics of the lag phase.
Additionally, retrospective spatial analyses can yield insights into the ecological processes involved in the spread non-native invasive species in novel regions.
For plant species, the specimen holdings of herbaria offer a rich source of data for these types of analyses.
Information from herbarium records are used in several studies to estimate species rates of spread through time and space [e.g., @Delisle2003; @Salo2005; @Miller2009; @Crawford2009; @Aikio2010a; @Lavoie2012], as well as to investigate native species range expansions beyond historical limits due to changing ecological conditions [e.g., @Feeley2011; @Feeley2012].

Despite their utility, analyzing these data present a number of challenges; and determining whether a species had an extended lag phase is not a trivial task.
One substantial challenge is that herbarium records may have been collected with unequal sampling effort in time and/ or space, resulting in biases.
For example, periods of high and low specimen collection for herbaria in general are well documented [@Prather2004].
There may also be herbarium specific trends, such as a peak in collection activity following the opening of a herbarium or an emphasis on regional specimen collection.
Other biases may emerge because of issues of convenience.
A noted pattern in natural history collections is the large number of specimens collected near museums, herbaria, botanical gardens, and academic centers, as well as urban areas in general, where there is a higher concentration of naturalists [@Hijmans2000; @Reddy2003; @Kadmon2004].
For plants collection, this is sometimes referred to as the “botanist effect”.
These potential biases make it difficult to determine if observed trends in herbarium collections (e.g., increased number of records through time) are indicative of changes in the population or range size of the species of interest, or rather, representative of trends in specimen collection.
For example, Catling and Porebski [-@Catling1994] found that observations of the plant *Frangula alnus* were generally concentrated around urban areas from the time this species was first observed in southern Ontario in the late 1800s up to the 1970s.
This pattern may be the result of the fact that botanists were located near these areas, and thus their collections tended to come from these areas, or it may be that *F. alnus* grows well in ecological conditions near urban areas (e.g., disturbed environments).
It is important to distinguish these patterns to use these data for understanding ecological processes of species invasions.

Another challenge in using herbarium records is that the data are
generally more conducive to studying spatial spread, rather than
population increase. These processes are related, but it should not be
assumed that the rate of spatial spread is equivalent to the rate of
population growth. This is problematic because whereas exponential
growth is widely accepted as a null model for local population growth,
there are many plausible null models for areal growth (i.e., spatial
spread) for range expanding species. One commonly used null model is a
reaction-diffusion model, which results in a description of spatial
growth as a function of the radius of the population. The area of
occupancy for a species spreading randomly on a landscape from a central
point should increase geometrically, with an exponent of 2. With this
assumption, the square root of the area of occupancy through time for a
spreading plant should have a linear relationship with respect to time,
analogous to linearity after log transform for exponential growth. While
other null models have been proposed, the square root transformation has
been shown to be applicable to most of these and used to examine
historical data on spatial spread (Crooks and Soulé 1999).

Given the promise of the utility of natural history collections in
general (Graham et al. 2004, Anderson 2012), and herbaria in particular
(Lavoie 2012), it is not surprising that the effects of unequal sampling
effort have been discussed in recent studies using herbarium records.
Most methods used to address these effects compare the trends in the
distribution of records for a species of interest to other species that
have similar habitat requirements – i.e. associated species (Miller et
al. 2009). For example, Catling and Porebski (1994) compared the pattern
of collection records of *F. alnus* to that of *Rhamnus alnifolia* and
showed that botanists were in fact collecting specimens well outside of
urban areas during the time frame of the introduction and early spread
of *F. alnus*. They thus concluded that *F. alnus* was in fact primarily
located near urban areas during this time. More recent developments in
analysis methods make it possible to account for potential biases in a
more robust manner than a simple visual comparison (e.g. (Delisle et al.
2003, Aikio et al. 2010a). These methods have been used to reconstruct
patterns of range expansion for both non-native and native plants (e.g.,
Miller et al. 2009; Larkin 2011). At least one of these methods (i.e.,
Aikio et al. 2010a) was specifically developed and applied to identify
the existence, and estimate the duration, of lag phases for invasive
plants. Adopting and modifying these methods, I address some of the
unanswered questions regarding the introduction and spread of the
non-native invasive plant *F. alnus* (Glossy buckthorn)*.*

*Frangula alnus* is purported to have had an extended lag phase (Catling
and Porebski 1994, Frappier et al. 2003b, Larkin 2011), and various
mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observation. Howell and
Blackwell (1977) suggested that the rapid expansion of *F. alnus* into
Ohio, following an extended period of presence in the eastern United
States may be associated with the rapid expansion of the non-native
European starling. Lending support to this idea, European starlings have
recently been linked to the spread the non-native invasive plant
*Celastrus orbiculatus* (Oriental bittersweet) (Merow et al. 2011),
which is also a woody fruit-bearing plant. However, Catling and Porebski
(1994) pointed out that the spread of *F. alnus* in southern Ontario
preceded the presence of European starlings, suggesting other mechanisms
must be at play. While Howell and Blackwell’s speculation concerns the
spread of *F. alnus* throughout the state of Ohio (\>110,000 km^2^),
Frappier and colleagues (2003b) speculate on a mechanism causing an
observed extended lag phase in the invasion of a 250 m^2^ forest plot,
suggesting that the lag may be due to “early selection and adaptation”
to the local ecological conditions. Despite these speculations, it
remains unclear as to whether *F. alnus* did in fact have an extended
lag phase.

In this study, I examined the range expansion of *F. alnus* throughout
its novel range of northeastern North American. I compiled a dataset of
historical occurrence observations of *F. alnus* consisting primarily of
herbarium records, but also including observations noted in the
scientific literature. Using these data I calculated metrics related to
the rate of spatial expansion of *F. alnus* throughout northeast North
America employing modified methods of (Delisle et al. 2003 and Aikio et
al. 2010a) to account for unequal sampling effort of herbarium records.
I hypothesized that my findings would support previous claims that *F.
alnus* experienced an extended lag lasting from the time of its
introduction (ca. 1860) to the early 1970s. The findings and patterns
established in this chapter provide an important foundation for further
analyses carried out in *Chapter 4*, in which I use linked population
and species distribution models to examine the population dynamics of
the *F. alnus* invasion. Many previous studies have used herbarium
records to estimate rates of spread and examine spatial patterns of
spread, but they have largely been limited to a regional focus. In this
study I investigated the range expansion of *F. alnus* throughout the
entire novel range. I expanded upon the methods of Delisle et al. (2003)
to allow for incorporation of data from multiple herbaria, while still
accounting for unequal effort in sampling. Access to herbaria records
and other historical biodiversity is increasing as more collections are
digitized and made available to the public. Having techniques to combine
information from desperate sources, so as I present here, will help
scientists use these data to investigate important standing questions.

**Methods**

*Collection of presence records*

I assembled a dataset of occurrence records for *F. alnus* to investigate its spread throughout northeast North America.
I collected historical presence records by 1) searching publicly available on-line databases of several herbaria, 2) requesting *F. alnus* record information from curators and collection managers of various herbaria, 3) searching the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and 4) carrying out a literature search for all North American localities, using the keyword search terms “Frangula alnus” or “Rhammus frangula” in ISI Web of Science database.
I only included presence records with information on the year and location (county level or finer) of observation in my dataset.
I accessed herbarium records from 30 herbaria via publically available on-line databases (Table 1).
Many herbaria manage on-line databases that include records from affiliated, but separate, herbaria.
For example, the Wisconsin State Herbarium is located at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
A search of the database for this herbarium yields accession records from this herbarium (WIS), as well as the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point herbarium (UWSP), the University of Wisconsin at Green Bay herbarium (UWGB), and the Morton Herbarium (MOR).
Therefore, while 30 herbaria are represented in my dataset, a smaller number of databases were used to acquire these records.
I contacted curators and collections managers at several herbaria directly to inquire about whether there were records for *F. alnus* in their collections.
Curators or collection managers at three herbaria, Rutgers Chrysler Herbarium, Miami University of Ohio Herbarium, and Carnegie Mellon Herbarium, provided me with the record information for all *F. alnus* or *R. frangula* in their collections.
In addition to collecting records from herbarium databases, I collected records accessed searching the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the Canada Biodiversity Information Facility (CBIF), and the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England (IPANE).
Records collected from all three of these biodiversity databases were carefully examined to exclude records accessed in other searches.

I searched for historical records of *F. alnus* presence reported in published journal articles using the ISI Web of Science database.
I used keyword search terms of “Frangula alnus” and “Rhamnus frangula”.
From this literature search, I included 5 presence records reported by Howell and Blackwell (1977), Taft and Solecki (1990), and Catling and Porebski (1994).
Howell and Blackwell (1977) investigated the history of the spread of *F. alnus* into and throughout Ohio, and reported that the first recorded observation was from Lake County, Ohio in 1927 (confirmed via search of Ohio State University Herbarium).
Taft and Solecki (1990) reported that *F. alnus* was first recorded in the state of Illinois in 1912 (Sherff 1912, as cited by Taft and Solecki 1990) in Cook County (confirmed via search of Field Museum Herbarium).
Catling and Porebski (1994) investigated the spread of *F. alnus* into and throughout southern Ontario.
I used data reported in this paper to identify time and location of the three earliest records of *F. alnus* presence in this region.

*Georeferencing of historical presence records*

Most of the presence records in the compiled dataset did not have
latitude and longitude values for where the specimen was collected.
However, many records had descriptive information, which I used to
assign latitude and longitude values to the collection location. This
process is commonly called georeferencing. I primarily used the
GoogleEarth software (Google Inc.) to georeference records (*sensu*
Garcia-Milagros & Funk 2010), however some cases required additional
Internet searches on named locations, such as unique building names or
geographic features. The descriptive location information allowed for
varying degrees of precision in the final latitude and longitude value
assigned to a record. At a minimum, all records of specimens collected
in the United States had enough information to be assigned to the county
in which the specimen was collected. For records with *only* county
level information, I assigned the US Census Bureau designated latitude
and longitude values to the record. For records of specimens collected
in Canada, I relied on the information included with the specimen to
assign county equivalent values. To achieve finer spatial resolution,
some information allowed for assigning values for the township the
specimen was collected in, whereas others allowed for assigning precise
locations. I assigned location uncertainty values using guidelines from
the Biogeomancer Consortium (BioGeomancer Consortium 2006) to all of the
georeferenced records. I carried out analyses using different subsets of
the compiled dataset based on the spatial resolution of the presence
record (described further below).

*Number of records through time*

Trends in the number of records added to an herbarium through time were
used to infer rates of spread for non-native invasive species and to
determine if a species experienced an extended lag phase (*sensu* (Pyšek
and Prach 1993, Aikio et al. 2010a). I calculated the cumulative number
of records reported per year in the dataset of compiled historical *F.
alnus* presences and plotted the log of the cumulative number of records
through time against years. I fit linear, quadratic, and cubic
regression lines to these data, and used a likelihood ratio test to
determine the best-fit model. I calculated an annual rate of growth for
the cumulative number of presence records by dividing the cumulative
number of records at year *t +* 1 by the cumulative number of records at
year *t*. The mean rate of growth was calculated as the geometric mean
of the annual growth rates. Additionally, I calculated 10-year moving
window geometric mean growth rates, which minimizes the influence of
extreme inter-annual fluctuations in growth rates. This yielded more
consistent rates of growth for the earliest period of the invasion,
during which time calculations are based on a relatively small number of
records.

*Area of occupancy through time*

I examined the spatial pattern and rate of range expansion of *F. alnus*
throughout its novel range using the dataset of compiled historical *F.
alnus* observations described above. To do this I created a map of equal
sized grid cells for the area of interest (Longitude: -97.0 – -62.0
degrees; Latitude: 38.0 – 48.0 degrees) using the Quantum GIS software
(QGIS Development Team 2012). Each grid cell was 5 x 5 arc minutes,
which is generally reported as 10 x 10 km. Because a unit of longitude
is smaller at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes, the area of each
grid cell decreases towards the poles. The area for each grid cell
ranges from ca. 67 km^2^ to ca. 57 km^2^. Because *F. alnus* occurrences
were widely distributed throughout the study region, I assumed the
effects of these differences in grid cell area would be negligible on
average. I used the R statistical programming environment (R Core Team
2012) with additionally functions from the “raster”, “rgdal”, and
“dismo” packages (Hijmans 2012, Keitt et al. 2012, Hijmans et al. 2013)
respectively) to carryout all other analyses. Each record in the
compiled dataset was assigned membership to one grid cell based on its
latitude and longitude value. If a grid cell contained at least one
occurrence of *F. alnus*, it was considered occupied. I calculated
multiple occupancy measures, including total area occupied per decade
and the cumulative area occupied from time of first introduction to the
present. In calculating the latter measure, I assumed that once a grid
cell was classified as occupied, it would not later be classified as
unoccupied. Similar measures have been used in other studies
investigating the spread of invasive species (e.g., (Pyšek and Prach
1995, Weber 1998, Delisle et al. 2003). Further, given the difficulty of
removing *F. alnus* and the lack of reported successful eradications, I
believe this is a reasonable assumption. I calculated the rate of growth
for the area of occurrence analogously to how I calculated the rate of
growth of the number of records (see *Number of records through time*).
I substituted the cumulative number of records with the cumulative
number of occupied grid cells and plotted the square root of the
cumulative number of grid cells versus time (years). Assuming areal
growth is a random diffusion process, this relationship should be linear
(\*\*CITATION NEEDED\*\*). A deviation from linearity that is concave up
indicates a period of time during which spatial spread is slower than
random diffusion. Likewise, a concave down curve indicates a period of
during which spatial spread is more rapid than random diffusion.

*Occupied counties through time*

Many records contained only enough spatial information to georeference
the collection location to the county in which it occurred. Furthermore,
georeferencing records to county requires substantially less time and
effort than higher levels of precision. Thus, analyzing spatial patterns
of herbarium records at the county level makes the compilation and use
of large datasets more achievable given limited time and resources,
while still providing insights into the patterns and processes of
species invasions (e.g., Barney 2006). Similar to the calculations of
*Area of occupancy through time*, I calculated the cumulative number of
counties occupied through time for the compiled dataset. Again, I
assumed that once *F. alnus* was found in a county, the county was
henceforth considered occupied. I calculated the growth rate for the
cumulative number of counties occupied in similar manner to how I
calculated the rate of growth of the number of records (see *Number of
records through time*).

*Accounting for unequal sampling effort in time and space*

The potential effects of unequal sampling effort complicate the
interpretation of observed patterns in historical presence locations.
One method for addressing these effects is to compare trends in records
of a species of interest to trends for a species, or group of species,
whose range and population size should be in equilibrium with their
environment (e.g., native species) (Delisle et al. 2003). I chose the
following group of associated native species, each of which has similar
habitat requirements as *F. alnus*: Speckled Alder (*Alnus incana*),
Smooth Alder (*Alnus serrulata*), Alderleaf Buckthorn (*Rhamnus
alnifolia*), Meadow Willow (*Salix peiolarisi*)*,* Witch Hazel
(*Hamamelis virginica* (syn. *macrophylla*)), and White Ash (*Fraxinus
Americana*). These species represent woody plants that are likely to be
observed in ecological conditions where *F. alnus* is observed. As noted
above, Catling and Porebski (1994) compared the distribution of record
collections for *R. alnifolia* to that of *F. alnus* as a comparison.
Similarly, *Salix peiolaris* was used in a paired comparison with *F.
alnus* in a study on the effects of invasive and native species on
wetland species diversity (Houlahan and Findlay 2004). The other species
in this group are found in ecological conditions conducive to the growth
of *F. alnus* (personal observations; Little et al. 1980; Sibley 2009).
To construct the associated species dataset, I searched GBIF for all
records that were located within the area of interest described in *Area
of occupancy through time*. Additionally, I collected all records for
these species reported in the following herbaria databases: University
of Wisconsin, Ohio State University, University of Minnesota, the Morton
Arboretum Herbarium, Michigan State University, and Brooklyn Botanic
Gardens. These records were georeferenced to the county level. Grouping
records for all of these species into one dataset, I calculated the
metrics for the number of records through time, the area of occupancy
through time, and the number of counties occupied through time, as
described above.

I compared the trends for *F. alnus* and the group of associated species
for both area of occupancy through time and counties occupied through
time in a similar manner to Delisle et al. (2003), who used herbarium
records to investigate the spread of six non-native species in Quebec,
Canada. They compared trends in area of occupancy through time by
dividing the cumulative number of occupied 10x10 km grid cells for each
non-native plant by the cumulative number of cells occupied by a group
of five native species, yielding a proportion of non-native to native
occupied cells for each year of their study period. It is important to
note that a major assumption in the interpretation of this analysis is
that spatial growth of native plants in the herbaria dataset does not
represent the spread for these plants *per se*, but rather represents
the increase in spatial coverage of herbaria records in general (i.e.,
an increase in the number of locations where samples are collected).
Thus, if the proportion of occupied cells between non-native and native
plants is increasing through time, this represents periods during which
the spatial coverage of records for the non-native plant outpaces the
background increase in spatial coverage. This can be interpreted as the
result of the non-native plant rapidly spreading in space.

In this study, I was interested in examining spatial spread in a larger
region than that studied in (Delisle et al. 2003), as well as in using
records from multiple herbaria across the full naturalized range of *F.
alnus*. This lead to several presence records for the group of
associated species being located in areas where *F. alnus* has not been
observed, most likely due to the larger niche breadth of some of the
associated species compared to *F. alnus,* (e.g., *Fraxinus americana*
(White Ash), as determined by examining the Biota of North America
Program – North American Plant Atlas; Kartesz 2013). Add citation into
final draft: Kartesz, J.T., The Biota of North America Program (BONAP).
2013. *North American Plant Atlas.* (http://www.bonap.org/napa.html).
Chapel Hill, N.C. [maps generated from Kartesz, J.T. 2013. Floristic
Synthesis of North America, Version 1.0. Biota of North America Program
(BONAP). (in press)]. Including these records in my analysis had the
effect of increasing the area of occupancy measures for the group of
associated species compared to the possible area of occupancy for *F.
alnus*. Similarly, the historical presence record dataset I manually
constructed included records of *F. alnus* from institutions from which
associated species records were not collected (e.g., Miami University
Herbarium and Rutgers Herbarium). The records acquired from these
institutions were largely geographically restricted (for example,
primarily located in the states of Ohio and New Jersey for the
institutions mentioned), and these locations were not always represented
well in the larger group of associated species dataset. Therefore,
including these records has the effect of increasing the area of
occupancy of *F. alnus* compared to the possible area of occupancy for
the group of associated species. To account for both of these issues, I
examined the ratio of cumulative area of occupancy of *F. alnus* to the
cumulative area of occupancy of the associated group of species,
limiting the records used to an area of coarse spatial overlap for both
datasets. I defined the spatial overlap by creating a map of equal sized
grid cells, again for the area of interest defined above, where each
grid cell was 30 x 30 arc minutes (i.e., 0.5° or approximately 50 x 50
km). As described in *Area of occupancy through time*, each record was
assigned membership to one 30’ grid cell based on its latitude and
longitude value. I then constructed restricted *F. alnus* and associated
species occurrence datasets, in which only records that occurred in a
30’ grid cell occupied by at least one record from *both* datasets
during the study period. Using these restricted datasets, I calculated
the ratio of the increase in the cumulative area of occupancy of *F.
alnus* to the group of associated species. In a separate analysis I
compared the cumulative number of counties occupied through time, while
accounting for similar concerns regarding falsely sampling regions in
space that are unsuitable to *F. alnus*. I only included records from
counties that were occupied at some time by both *F. alnus* and one of
the associated plants. In this case, the ratio of the cumulative number
of counties occupied at the end of the study period had to equal 1.0.
The growth rates for the cumulative number of grid cells occupied and
the cumulative number of counties occupied were compared between *F.
alnus* and the group of associated species. To compare the growth rates
I divided the annual growth rate of *F. alnus* records by the annual
growth rate of the entire group of associated species.

*Comparison of number of records through time*

In addition to comparing trends in the areal increase of *F. alnus* and
the associated species, I also compared trends in the cumulative number
of records through time. For each year of the study period, I divided
the cumulative number of *F. alnus* records by the cumulative number of
associated species records. This correction method is similar to that
proposed by (Delisle et al. 2003) and has been used in several studies
to account for bias due to unequal sampling effort (e.g., Mihulka &
Pyšek 2001; Aikio et al. 2010a; Larkin 2011). Additionally, to compare
rates at which *F. alnus* and associated species occurrences were
collected, I calculated the ratio of growth rates using both the annual
and 10-year moving window average estimates. A ratio value less than 1.0
indicated that the rate at which *F. alnus* occurrences were being
collected was lower than that of the associated species, while a ratio
value of greater than 1.0 indicated that it was greater that that of the
associated species.

**Results**

I compiled a dataset of 749 occurrence records for *F. alnus* and 5548
occurrence records for the combined group of associated species.
*Frangula alnus* specimens have been collected in much of northeast and
middle North America (Figure 2), and collection locations for the group
of associated species was largely inclusive of where *F. alnus* was
collected. The earliest dated occurrence record for *F. alnus* was an
herbarium specimen collected in 1879 in Hudson County, New Jersey
(accessed from CHRB). The earliest dated occurrence record for an
associated species was a herbarium record for *Hamamelis virginiana*
collected in 1836 in Richland County, Ohio (accessed from CM). Only 36
associated species records pre-dated the first *F. alnus* record,
representing less than 1% of the associated records. A total of 14 *F.
alnus* specimens were deposited in 4 separate herbaria prior to 1900. Of
these records, 12 were georeferenced to the metropolitan New York City
area (9 in the state of New Jersey) and the remaining 2 were collected
in southern Ontario (as reported in Catling & Porebski 1994). Based on
recorded specimen collection dates, the number of herbarium specimens
collected for both *F. alnus* and the group of associated species has
increased through time (Figure 3). For the group of associated species,
there was a substantial increase in the number of records collected at
the beginning of the 20^th^ century, followed by another increase after
1950. There was a steady increase in the number of records collected per
decade from the time of the first recorded presence of *F. alnus* in the
United States to the end of the 20^th^ century. For both groups, there
was a dramatic decline in the number of records at the start of 21^st^
century, which is a pattern that has been observed elsewhere (Prather et
al. 2004).

The log cumulative number of records through time indicates that the
rate at which records were added to herbaria for both *F. alnus* and the
group of associated species does not fit an exponential growth
relationship (i.e., a linear relationship) (Figure 4A). The best-fit
regression models of log cumulative number of records versus time
(years) were a cubic polynomial regression for *F. alnus* (R^2^ = 0.989,
df = 124, P \<\< 0.05) and a quadratic polynomial regression for the
group of associated species (R^2^ =0.979, df = 174, P\<\<0.05
respectively), both departing from a linear relationship. The cumulative
number of records for the group of associated species increased steadily
from the late 1800s to the present. The cumulative number of records for
*F. alnus* increased rapidly from the late 1800s to approximately 1930.
Ratios of the annual growth rates and ten year moving average (geometric
mean) growth rates show that the rate at which *F. alnus* collections
occurred was generally slower than that of the group of associated
species prior to approximately 1920, but faster during most of the
20^th^ century (Figure 4B). The ratio of the cumulative increase in
records of *F. alnus* to the associated species corroborates this
pattern, indicating that the increase of *F. alnus* records was greater
than the associated species from 1920 to the present (Figure 4C).

The cumulative number of occupied 5 arc min grid cells for *F. alnus*
and the associated species, constrained to overlap within 30 arc min
grid cells, increased through time for both datasets (Figure 5). A plot
of the square root of cumulative occupied grid cells versus time
supports a departure from a simple diffusion model of spatial spread in
historical presence records (Figure 5A). If a random diffusion process
governed the spatial spread of herbaria record locations, a linear
regression would be the best-fit model of the square root of cumulative
records versus time (Crooks and Soulé 1999). In contrast, based on
likelihood ratio tests, the best-fit regression models of the square
root of the cumulative number of grid cells occupied, with year as the
predictor variable, were a quadratic polynomial regression for *F.
alnus* (R^2^ = 0.996, df = 129, P \<\< 0.05) and a cubic polynomial
regression for the group of associated species (R^2^ = 0.990, df = 140,
P \<\< 0.05), both indicating a departure from linearity. The rate of
increase in occurrence records was low for both *F. alnus* and the group
of associated species until 1890, after which the number of occupied
cells rapidly increases for the group of associated species. In
contrast, the number of occupied cells continued to increase slowly for
*F. alnus* until approximately 1920, as is demonstrated by the
calculated ratio between the two growth rates (Figure 5B). Prior to
1915, with the exception of the earliest years of the *F. alnus*
invasion, the rate at which new grid cells were considered occupied by
*F. alnus* was lower than the corresponding rate for the group of
associated species. From 1915 to the present, the rate at which grid
cells are considered occupied by *F. alnus* was consistently higher than
the corresponding rate of growth for the associated species. The ratio
of the cumulative number of occupied grid cells of *F. alnus* to the
associated species shows that after approximately 1910 the rate at which
*F. alnus* increased in area of occurrence was greater than that of the
group of associated species (Figure 5C).

Trends in the cumulative number of counties occupied were similar to the
results of the analysis of the cumulative number of occupied grid cells.
As noted in *Occupied counties through time*, the compiled records
dataset for both *F. alnus* and the associated species was subset to
include records from counties that were occupied by both during the
study period. The number of counties where herbarium samples were
collected increased very rapidly during the late 19^th^ to early 20^th^
century, as indicated by rapid increase in the cumulative occupied
counties for the associated species. The number of counties where *F.
alnus* was found increased very slowly during the early part of the
20^th^ century, but rapidly after 1940 (Figure 6A). Assuming counties
were selected as locations for herbarium specimen collections at random,
the relationship between the square root of the cumulative number of
occupied counties and time (years) should be linear for the associated
species. However, this is not the relationship for either the associated
species or *F. alnus* (Figure 6A). Compared to linear and quadratic
regression models, a cubic polynomial regression model was the best fit
model for both the associated species (R^2^ = 0.967, df = 166, P \<
0.001) and *F. alnus* (R^2^ = 0.997, df = 130, P \< 0.001), as
determined by a likelihood ratio test. The difference in the rate of
growth of cumulative occupied counties between *F. alnus* and the
associated species shows a similar pattern to that reported for
cumulative occupied grid cells (Figure 6B). The rate at which counties
are considered occupied is slower for *F. alnus* than the associated
species early in the invasion history (prior to 1900) and faster during
most of the 20^th^ century (Figure 6B). The ratio of occupied counties
of *F. alnus* to those occupied by the associated species indicates that
early in the invasion history, *F. alnus* was less frequently collected
in newly sampled counties, but that for most of the 20^th^ century the
number of counties occupied by *F. alnus* has increased more rapidly
than the number of counties occupied by associated species (Figure 6C).
*F. alnus* specimens were collected on average 48 years after at least
one of the associated species had been collected in a county. \~\~While
the distribution of years between sampling of an associated species and
*F. alnus* is quite wide (standard deviation = 44; Figure 7), the first
year an associated species was collected in a county was significantly
earlier than the first year *F. alnus* was sampled in that county
(paired t-test, t = -15.57, df = 196, P \<\< 0.05).\~\~

\*\*\*\* I am not convinced that Fig 7 is important. The only piece of
useful and relevant information that can be gleaned from it is that for
most counties, some sampling occurred many years prior to finding
Buckthorn there. If this stays in the paper at all, it could potentially
go into a supporting information, but more likely, I can simply state
the overall result, probably in the discussion.

**Discussion**

*Early observations and likely region of first introduction*

The question of *how* *F. alnus* was introduced remains unanswered.
Based on its long history of use as a medicinal plant (United States
Pharmacopeial Convention 1910) and evidence that it was planted as an
ornamental shrub (Sherff 1912) Add reference to Sudworth and Fernow:
(Sudworth, G. B. and B. E. Fernow.  1891.  *Trees of Washington, D.C.*,
compliments of the Forestry Division. Geo. B. Sudworth, botanist ; B. E.
Fernow, chief.  Washington, D.C.: Bell Lithographing Co.  [18] pp.; 2
folding plans; 14 x 22 cm.), it is likely the *F. alnus* was purposely
planted in many locations in North America. In fact, low fertility
cultivars of *F. alnus* are still available for purchase (Jacquart and
Knight 2010). A thorough investigation of seed catalogs and nursery
records from the late 19^th^ century may shed more light on when and
where it was planted, but was beyond the scope of this project. As is
the case with many non-native species, there is little documented
evidence of the time(s) or place(s) that *F. alnus* was introduced. The
most frequently referenced time of first introduction is the mid-19^th^
century (Catling and Porebski 1994, Possessky et al. 2000, Frappier et
al. 2003a), however at least one source suggests it occurred prior to
1800 (Converse 1984). This source may mistakenly be referring to the
closely related *Rhamnus cathartica* (Common Buckthorn; Kurylo et al.
2007). The location of first introduction has been reported variably as
“the eastern states” (Howell and Blackwell 1977) and Canada (Frappier et
al. 2003a). My findings suggest that a potential location of first
introduction was the metropolitan New York City area and areas of New
Jersey along New York Harbor. Specimens for 12 of 14 records dating from
before 1900 were collected in this region. *F. alnus* was present in
this region for more than a decade before it was first reported in
southern Ontario, countering the claim that southern Canada was the
location of first introduction. However, locations in southern Ontario
account for the remaining 2 of 14 records dating before 1900, indicating
that introduction into the region was likely early during the spread of
*F. alnus*. It is interesting to note that the region the first recorded
observations come from was a large shipping and port area, raising the
possibility that shipping played a role in an accidental introduction.
Many non-native plants have been introduced to port areas by the
unloading of solid ballast, with seeds mixed in with rocks and other
materials used as ballast (Sorrie 2005, Barney 2006). However, this
region historical had a high population density, thus there also may
have been more people who purposely planted *F. alnus*.

*Accounting for unequal sampling effort in historical biodiversity
collections *

Using historical biodiversity collections to reconstruct patterns of
species presence presents many challenges. One of the most common is the
presence of unequal sampling effort (Reddy and Dávalos 2003, Graham et
al. 2004, Kadmon et al. 2004, Boakes et al. 2010). For herbaria in
particular, there are many reasons for unequal sampling effort in
specimen collection, some of which have been discussed above (i.e. the
‘botanist effect’). Another potential cause is herbaria specific
emphasis on regional collections. For example, the Oberlin Herbarium
collection (housed in the Ohio State Herbarium) includes several
thousand records primarily collected from within the state of Ohio.
Thus, confronted with numerous records of *F. alnus* in Ohio in the
compiled dataset, it is hard to discern if conditions in Ohio are
favorable for establishment and spread of buckthorn, or if this region
is simply better sampled than others. There may also be unequal sampling
effort associated with taxonomic grouping. There are numerous examples
of collections of orchids, bryophytes, mosses, and ferns, which are all
groups of particular interest to plant collectors.

Calculating the ratio of the cumulative number of records in space and
time of non-native to native plants offers a way to account for unequal
sampling effort, making it possible to distinguish periods of relatively
slow versus rapid spread (Delisle et al. 2003). The primary assumption
in this correction method is that native species are in equilibrium with
their environment prior to the collection of any records. That is, these
plants have spread to all of the ecological conditions within the study
range where they can survive and reproduce, and have a stable range
distribution. There are some caveats to this assumption to consider,
perhaps the most important being that the ecological conditions in
northeast North America have not been stable over the last 130 years.
There have been substantial changes in land use, resulting in changes to
plant communities (Wright and Fridley 2010), as well as affecting plant
invasion dynamics (Mosher et al. 2009). However, given that the species
chosen for the group of associated species have similar ecological
requirements as *F. alnus*, I expect that any such changes would affect
trends in these species and *F. alnus* equally.

Provided the equilibrium assumption is true for the group of associated
species in this study, then the rate of the cumulative number of
records, grid cells, or counties occupied is not representative of the
spread of these plants, but rather of the effort of herbarium specimen
collectors. As such, if the ratio of cumulative records of *F. alnus* to
the associated species is increasing in time, this indicates a period
during which *F. alnus* is increasing more rapidly than background
sampling, and thus experiencing positive growth rates. If the ratio is
constant, *F. alnus* may be increasing, however it is not
distinguishable from sampling effort. If the ratio is decreasing, *F.
alnus* may still be increasing, but more slowly than the rate of
sampling effort. Because the *cumulative* number of records was used in
all three temporal trends calculated in this study, the absolute rate of
change in samples cannot show a decline. Time periods that have either
decreasing or stable ratio values, which precede periods of increasing
ratio values, may be considered lags.

*Cumulative records through time*

All three of the calculated ratio values suggest that *F. alnus*
increased since ca. 1920 even when increased sampling effort was taken
into account (Figures 4C, 5C, and 6C). The ratio of sample growth rates
also supports this claim. For all three trends, the ratio of ten-year
average growth rates was greater than 1.0 after 1920, indicating that
the number of *F. alnus* samples increased more rapidly than those of
the group of associated species (Figures 4B, 5B, and 6B). Prior to 1920,
both the ratio values of cumulative number of records and growth rates
fluctuated greatly. This may be the result of the relatively small
number of cumulative records for both *F. alnus* and the associated
species during this time. The addition of a small number of records to
either dataset could drastically change the ratio between them. The
accumulation of *F. alnus* occurrences had a particularly large effect
early in its invasion history, as is indicated by the ratio of growth
rates, in which generally *F. alnus* records increased more slowly than
the associated species from 1879 to the 1920s, but there are anomalous
years in which the growth rate of *F. alnus* was much larger than that
of the associated species (Figures 4B, 5B, and 6B). For example, when
the cumulative number of records for *F. alnus* increased from 4 to 10
from 1893 to 1894, the resulting growth rate was R = 2.5. Comparatively,
during this time the number of records for the associated species
increased from 171 to 191, resulting in a growth rate of R = 1.12. Thus,
it is difficult to determine if *F. alnus* did in fact start its
invasion with a very high growth rate, then immediately slowed, or
rather this result is an artifact of calculating growth rates with small
sample sizes. Based on the relative consistency of the total number of
records collected in each decade, there is more support for the latter
interpretation (Figure 3).

*Spatial spread and area of occupancy through time*

Given the equilibrium assumption of native species, if the cumulative
number of grid cells (and counties) occupied by the associated species
were appropriately represented by a random diffusion process (i.e.,
linear when regressing square root of the cumulative number of grid
cells onto time), this would imply that specimen collectors moved
randomly outward from a central point, e.g. an herbarium, collecting new
records as they went. Neither the cumulative number of grid cells nor
counties occupied fit such a relationship (Figures 5A and 6A). In both
cases, the trend can be described as concave up initially, followed by a
linear trend with a steep slope, followed by a concave down curve,
followed by another period of linearity. This suggests that the rate of
collections increased rapidly in the mid 19^th^ century, was high
throughout the second half of the 19^th^ century, and then decelerated
during the 20^th^ century. The cubic regression fits do not necessarily
support the presumption of an early concave up portion of the curve, but
do support the interpretation of a rapid rate of increase early in the
collection history, followed by a deceleration in collection rate.
However, more complex curve fitting such as GAM or piecewise linear
regression may more closely fit these data. Regardless, it is clear that
specimen collection rapidly spread across the landscape during the
19^th^ century. Combined with the increase in the cumulative number of
records during earlier part of the study period (Figures 3 and 4A),
these patterns suggest that this was a period of high sampling effort,
coinciding with the beginning of an intense effort to collect specimens
for herbaria (Prather et al. 2004).

The earliest occurrence records of *F. alnus* were collected during this
period of high sampling effort. However, it was uncommon across the
study region at this time, and appears to have remained uncommon until
at least the 1920s. Assuming that cumulative occurrence curves for the
associated species represent the spatial spread of collection effort,
and that a collector would collect *F. alnus* if it were present during
a survey, it appears that the rate of spatial spread during the early
19^th^ century of *F. alnus* was slow. This is most clearly exemplified
by the trends in cumulative number of counties occupied through time. On
average *F. alnus* was first observed 48 years after at least one of the
associated species was observed in a county occupied by both by the end
of the study period. By 1900, records for at least one of the associated
species was collected in 42% (73 of 172) of counties, where as *F.
alnus* was collected in 2% (4 of 172) of counties. This strongly
suggests that *F. alnus* was not common at this time. However, the ratio
of occurrence records shows a consistent rate of spread throughout the
novel range during the following 100 years.

*Evidence for an extended lag phase*

Compared to most previous studies, here I examined the spread of an
invasive species over a spatial area incorporating nearly all of the
known naturalized range. Examining the relative rates of increase in
occupied grid cells and occupied counties at this spatial scale, there
is no compelling evidence for an extended lag phase persisting beyond
the early 20^th^ century. All three analyses suggest that *F. alnus*
increased at a rate greater than sampling effort from at least 1920 on.
Given that the rate of increase in record number and spatial occurrence
for *F. alnus* was less than that of the associated species from 1880 to
1920, it is plausible that this period of time represents an extended
lag phase. However, trends calculated for this period are based on a
small number of *F. alnus* records, as is evident in the high
variability in both the ratio of growth rates and the ratio of records
or occupied area.

Three previous studies examined aspects of the range expansion of
*Frangula alnus* using herbarium records (Howell and Blackwell 1977,
Catling and Porebski 1994, Larkin 2011). Each focused on only part of
the invaded range. Howell & Blackwell (1977) examined the spread of *F.
alnus* (using the synonym *Rhamnus frangula*) into, and throughout,
Ohio. They found evidence that it likely entered Ohio in the 1920’s,
being observed first in Lake County (northeastern Ohio). The authors
speculate that the spread of *F. alnus* westward throughout Ohio was
facilitated by the range-expansion of the non-native European Starling.
Many bird species are noted to eat the fruit of *F. alnus* and defecate
undigested seeds, and European Starlings in particular have been known
to eat these fruit (Howell & Blackwell 1977). The authors did not
account for potential unequal sampling effort in herbarium records, but
rather simply reported when and where *F. alnus* first appeared in Ohio.
Catling & Porebski (1994) examined the historical spread of *F. alnus*
in southern Ontario, Canada (also using the synonym *R. frangula*) and
found that it was first recorded in London, Ontario in 1898 and Ottawa
in 1899. Their data suggested that *F. alnus* spread to other urban
centers, but primarily remained confined to these areas until the
1970’s. From the 1970’s to the early 1990’s *F. alnus* spread into
natural areas outside of urban areas at an increased rate compared to
the previous 70 years. The authors suggest that this observation is
indicative of a lag phase in the spread of *F. alnus*, though no
quantitative analysis was carried out. To address potential biases
resulting from unequal sampling efforts, specifically for records
collected prior to 1930, the authors visually compared the spatial
distribution of the *F. alnus* records with that of native *Rhamnus
alnifolia*, a species with similar habitat requirements. More recently,
Larkin (2011) examined the lengths of lag phases for multiple (\>200)
species of non-native invasive species in the Wisconsin and the southern
Lake Michigan region, applying the methods of (Aikio et al. 2010a). The
earliest record of *F. alnus* was collected in 1908 in the southern Lake
Michigan region, and based on quantitative analysis had a 31-year lag
phase. Comparatively, it was found in southern and northern Wisconsin in
1927 and 1941, and had 36- and 15-year lag phases, respectively. These
years of first regional introduction suggest that *F. alnus* spread
north from the southern Lake Michigan region into more northern parts of
Wisconsin. The length of the lag phase calculated for southern Lake
Michigan and southern Wisconsin generally agrees with my observations
for the whole range.

*Caveats and potential sources of bias*

I made several assumptions in carrying out the analyses presented here.
One assumption of note is that I treated the cumulative number of
occupied grid cells, and counties, as representative of the area of
extent. This may not be valid if *F. alnus* invades an area, but later
goes locally extinct. This is an unlikely occurrence. With one notable
exception (Cunard and Lee 2008), there are no documented examples of the
local extinction of *F. alnus*, either by natural processes or
management actions. This supports the notion that once a location is
occupied, it remains so. However, I am confident that some locations of
historical *F. alnus* occurrences no longer have the species present
because of changes in land use (e.g., development of once-woodland
plots). This is the case for several of the records observed in the
metropolitan New York region, the site of many of the earliest records.
Disturbances, or removal of population from the landscape, due to
anthropogenic influences may have a substantial effect on the spread of
*F. alnus* throughout its novel region. Nevertheless, it can be
successful in very small, isolated, and disturbed plots within a urban
or suburban land-use matrix (personal observation; (Del Tredici 2010).
Ultimately, the finest spatial resolution used in this study was 5 x 5
arc minutes (approximately 10 x 10 km) for the occupied grid cells
through time. The spatial resolution for the number of counties through
time varies, but the mean county area for all counties in the study
region is approximately 1500 km^2^, making it more course than the
occupied grid cells through time. For both resolutions, a complete local
extinction of *F. alnus* is unlikely.

A challenge in using historical biodiversity collections is that most
herbaria do not have electronic databases of their holdings that are
easily accessed by the public (i.e., a web-base search interface) and
many do not have a complete electronic database of records within the
institution (Lavoie 2012). Therefore, I know there are several herbaria
records that were not included in my compiled dataset because I did not
acquire them. Nevertheless, given the extent of the data compilation in
space and across institutions, I am confident that the patterns and
trends reported are generally representative of the spread of *F.
alnus*. I was able to collect records from some herbaria by directly
contacting curators and collection managers. Many collection managers
were happy to provide me with record information for *F. alnus*, in part
because there were generally a small number of records, and some were
able to provide me with information from records of the group of
associated species. However, because of the large request entailed in
collecting records for the associated species, I was not able to collect
these records from some herbaria. This is particularly problematic
because I focused my direct contact efforts on herbaria that I either
knew contained *F. alnus* (e.g. Miami University Herbarium) or herbaria
in regions that I thought were lacking in records collected by other
means. These collection issues result in underestimates of the amount of
area occupied by *F. alnus*, and further collections could potentially
increase the accuracy of my results.

**\

**Conclusions**

Despite concerns regarding the extent to which the compiled dataset
approximates a complete representation of the area occupied by *F.
alnus* through time, my results clearly support a rapid rate of spread
for this species throughout its invasion history. Calculating the ratio
of the cumulative number of grid cells and counties occupied by *F.
alnus* to those occupied by the group of associated species, I was able
identify time-periods associated with the expansion of *F. alnus* while
accounting for potential unequal spatial and temporal sampling bias in
occurrence record collection. Based on these calculations, *F. alnus*
has expanded rapidly throughout its invaded range since the mid to late
1920s. Patterns of spatial spread and estimates of lag phase duration
likely vary between regions. However, a quantitative analysis from one
region yielded a length for an extended lag phase consistent with what
was observed throughout the entire invaded range (Larkin 2011). The
patterns and processes of range expansion, particularly of lag phase
dynamics, likely vary depending on scale and local ecological conditions
(Theoharides and Dukes 2007). Further analysis could entail using the
datasets I have compiled, but restricting the calculations carried out
here to regional levels. I examine these patterns from a different
perspective in *Chapter 4*, where I use integrated species distribution
and demographic models to investigate the local and regional population
processes that result in the patterns I found in this chapter. This
integration allows for an examination of how local population processes,
such as individual plant survival, fruit production, and seed dispersal,
propagate to regional patterns such as those discussed here.
