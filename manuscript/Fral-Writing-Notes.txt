For example, Catling and Porebski (1994) found that observations of the plant Frangula alnus were generally concentrated around urban areas from the time this species was first observed in southern Ontario, late 1800s, up to the 1970s. This pattern may be the result of the fact that botanists were located near these areas, and thus their collections tended to come from these areas, or it may be that F. alnus grows well in ecological conditions near urban areas (e.g., disturbed environments). 


Adopting and modifying these methods, I address unanswered questions regarding the introduction and spread of the non-native invasive plant F. alnus throughout its full naturalized range.


# CONSIDER PUTTING MOST OF THIS PARAGRAPH INTO THE DISCUSSION SECTION: 

Frangula alnus is purported to have had an extended lag phase (Catling and Porebski 1994, Frappier et al. 2003b, Larkin 2011), and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observation. Howell and Blackwell (1977) suggested that the rapid expansion of F. alnus into Ohio, following an extended period of presence in the eastern United States may be associated with the rapid expansion of the non-native European starling. Lending support to this idea, European starlings have recently been linked to the spread the non-native invasive plant Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) (Merow et al. 2011), which is also a woody fruit-bearing plant. However, Catling and Porebski (1994) pointed out that the spread of F. alnus  in southern Ontario preceded the presence of European starlings, suggesting other mechanisms must be at play. While Howell and Blackwell’s speculation concerns the spread of F. alnus throughout the state of Ohio (>110,000 km2), Frappier and colleagues (2003b) speculate on a mechanism causing an observed extended lag phase in the invasion of a 250 m2 forest plot, suggesting that the lag may be due to “early selection and adaptation” to the local ecological conditions. Despite these speculations, it remains unclear as to whether F. alnus did in fact have an extended lag phase. 


# MOVE FROM THE METHODS TO THE RESULTS:

I accessed 30 herbaria via on-line databases (Table 1). Many herbaria manage on-line databases that include records from affiliated, but separate, herbaria. For example, the Wisconsin State Herbarium is located at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. A search of the database for this herbarium yields accession records from this herbarium (WIS), as well as the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point herbarium (UWSP), the University of Wisconsin at Green Bay herbarium (UWGB), and the Morton Herbarium (MOR). Therefore, while 30 herbaria are represented in my dataset, a smaller number of databases were used to acquire these records. 

I searched for historical records of F. alnus presence reported in published journal articles using the ISI Web of Science database. I used keyword search terms of “Frangula alnus” and “Rhamnus frangula”. From this literature search, I included 5 presence records reported by Howell and Blackwell (1977), Taft and Solecki (1990), and Catling and Porebski (1994). Howell and Blackwell (1977) investigated the history of the spread of F. alnus into and throughout Ohio, and reported that the first recorded observation was  from Lake County, Ohio in 1927 (confirmed via search of Ohio State University Herbarium). Taft and Solecki (1990) reported that F. alnus was first recorded in the state of Illinois in 1912 (Sherff 1912, as cited by Taft and Solecki 1990) in Cook County (confirmed via search of Field Museum Herbarium). Catling and Porebski (1994) investigated the spread of F. alnus into and throughout southern Ontario. I used data reported in this paper to identify time and location of the three earliest records of F. alnus presence in this region.
