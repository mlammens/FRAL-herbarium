For example, Catling and Porebski (1994) found that observations of the plant Frangula alnus were generally concentrated around urban areas from the time this species was first observed in southern Ontario, late 1800s, up to the 1970s. This pattern may be the result of the fact that botanists were located near these areas, and thus their collections tended to come from these areas, or it may be that F. alnus grows well in ecological conditions near urban areas (e.g., disturbed environments). 


Adopting and modifying these methods, I address unanswered questions regarding the introduction and spread of the non-native invasive plant F. alnus throughout its full naturalized range.


# CONSIDER PUTTING MOST OF THIS PARAGRAPH INTO THE DISCUSSION SECTION: 

Frangula alnus is purported to have had an extended lag phase (Catling and Porebski 1994, Frappier et al. 2003b, Larkin 2011), and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observation. Howell and Blackwell (1977) suggested that the rapid expansion of F. alnus into Ohio, following an extended period of presence in the eastern United States may be associated with the rapid expansion of the non-native European starling. Lending support to this idea, European starlings have recently been linked to the spread the non-native invasive plant Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) (Merow et al. 2011), which is also a woody fruit-bearing plant. However, Catling and Porebski (1994) pointed out that the spread of F. alnus  in southern Ontario preceded the presence of European starlings, suggesting other mechanisms must be at play. While Howell and Blackwell’s speculation concerns the spread of F. alnus throughout the state of Ohio (>110,000 km2), Frappier and colleagues (2003b) speculate on a mechanism causing an observed extended lag phase in the invasion of a 250 m2 forest plot, suggesting that the lag may be due to “early selection and adaptation” to the local ecological conditions. Despite these speculations, it remains unclear as to whether F. alnus did in fact have an extended lag phase. 


# MOVE FROM THE METHODS TO THE RESULTS:

I accessed 30 herbaria via on-line databases (Table 1). Many herbaria manage on-line databases that include records from affiliated, but separate, herbaria. For example, the Wisconsin State Herbarium is located at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. A search of the database for this herbarium yields accession records from this herbarium (WIS), as well as the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point herbarium (UWSP), the University of Wisconsin at Green Bay herbarium (UWGB), and the Morton Herbarium (MOR). Therefore, while 30 herbaria are represented in my dataset, a smaller number of databases were used to acquire these records. 

I searched for historical records of F. alnus presence reported in published journal articles using the ISI Web of Science database. I used keyword search terms of “Frangula alnus” and “Rhamnus frangula”. From this literature search, I included 5 presence records reported by Howell and Blackwell (1977), Taft and Solecki (1990), and Catling and Porebski (1994). Howell and Blackwell (1977) investigated the history of the spread of F. alnus into and throughout Ohio, and reported that the first recorded observation was  from Lake County, Ohio in 1927 (confirmed via search of Ohio State University Herbarium). Taft and Solecki (1990) reported that F. alnus was first recorded in the state of Illinois in 1912 (Sherff 1912, as cited by Taft and Solecki 1990) in Cook County (confirmed via search of Field Museum Herbarium). Catling and Porebski (1994) investigated the spread of F. alnus into and throughout southern Ontario. I used data reported in this paper to identify time and location of the three earliest records of F. alnus presence in this region.

## Some notes and thoughts about the null model results - this should be added to the manuscript

Examining the patterns in the null model analysis of Cummulative AOO and AOO Ratio Through Time, the existence of a lag phase for FRAL from its introduction untill approximately 1920 seems more apparent. The decline in the AOO ratio from 1880 to ca. 1900 strongly suggests that this period was one of rapid collection of the associated species. Given the commoness of these species, it is likely that this corresponds with a period of rapid collection in herbaria records more broadly. This corresponds with the increase in records collections, and peak recording decades, reported by Prather et al. for a number of the herbaria included in my study.

# SECTION ON SPATIAL NULL MODEL CHOICE - SQUARE ROOT

Another challenge is that the data from herbaria are generally more conducive to studying spatial spread, rather than population increase. These processes are related, but we cannot assume that the rate of spatial spread is equivalent to the rate of population growth. This is problematic because whereas exponential growth is widely accepted as a null model for local population growth, there are many plausible null models for spatial spread. A reaction-diffusion model is commonly applied, where spatial growth is a function of the radius of the population. The area of occupancy for a species spreading randomly on a landscape from a central point increases geometrically, with an exponent of 2. Thus, the square root of the area of occupancy through time for a spreading species should have a linear relationship with respect to time, analogous to linearity after log transform for exponential growth. While there are several null models, the square root transformation has been found to be appropriate in most situations (Crooks and Soulé 1999).


## Likely to be removed

**I moved the passage below for now, in my work toward demphasizing the lag-phase parts of the paper.**

Identifying a lag phase is not trivial. Newly established populations should increase exponentially, assuming neither positive or negative density dependent effects (i.e. Allee effects or intra-specific competition, respectively). In this case, a plot of population size through time yields an exponential growth curve. Crooks and Soulé (1999) describe “the shallow portion early in the growth curve when the population is growing relatively slowly in absolute number” as the inherent lag. However, lacking a proper mathematical definition, it is difficult to identify an inherent lag phase. In fact, a plot of the log of population size versus time would show a linear relationship, indicating no distinct transition point between the inherent lag phase and a rapid growth phase. In contrast, we can readily identify an extended lag phase. During an extended lag, population growth is slower than the potential maximum. A plot of log of population size versus time is non-linear when the population growth rate is accelerating. The period when the population is experiencing lower growth rates than maximum is the extended lag (Crooks and Soulé 1999). POSSIBLY ADD CONNECTION TO SPATIAL SPREAD.
